# Coverage Setup Complete ✅

## Task 5.4: Test Coverage Reporting and Validation

Successfully implemented comprehensive test coverage reporting and validation system for the Burly MCP project.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced pyproject.toml Configuration
- **Coverage Settings**: Added comprehensive coverage configuration with 80% minimum threshold
- **Branch Coverage**: Enabled branch coverage tracking for more thorough analysis
- **Multiple Report Formats**: Configured HTML, XML, and JSON report generation
- **Pytest Integration**: Added coverage flags to default pytest execution

#### 2. Coverage Validation Script (`scripts/check_coverage.py`)
- **Automated Validation**: Python script to run tests and validate coverage thresholds
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive coverage reports with file-by-file breakdown
- **Flexible Execution**: Supports unit-only, integration-only, or full test runs
- **CI/CD Ready**: Designed for integration with automated pipelines

#### 3. Shell Script Runner (`scripts/run_coverage.sh`)
- **Convenient Interface**: Bash script for easy coverage testing
- **Color Output**: User-friendly colored output for status reporting
- **Prerequisites Check**: Validates environment setup before running tests
- **Multiple Commands**: Supports clean, validate, report, and test operations

#### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`)
- **Automated CI/CD**: Complete workflow for coverage validation in pull requests
- **Coverage Comparison**: Compares coverage between PR and base branch
- **Codecov Integration**: Uploads coverage reports to Codecov for tracking
- **PR Comments**: Automatically comments coverage results on pull requests

### Current Status

**Overall Coverage**: 29.17% (below 80% threshold - expected for restructure phase)

**Files Needing Attention**:
- `tools/registry.py`: 12.12%
- `server/main.py`: 14.56%
- `policy/engine.py`: 24.47%
- `resource_limits.py`: 27.49%
- `audit.py`: 27.82%

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python scripts/check_coverage.py

# Run unit tests only
python scripts/check_coverage.py --unit-only

# Validate existing coverage without running tests
python scripts/check_coverage.py --validate-only

# Use shell script for convenience
./scripts/run_coverage.sh all
./scripts/run_coverage.sh --min-coverage 85 unit
./scripts/run_coverage.sh clean
```

### Next Steps

The coverage infrastructure is now complete and ready for use. As the project development continues:

1. **Test Implementation**: Focus on writing tests for low-coverage modules
2. **Coverage Improvement**: Target the files identified in the coverage report
3. **CI/CD Integration**: The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically validate coverage on all PRs
4. **Monitoring**: Use the coverage reports to track progress toward the 80% goal

### Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Enhanced with comprehensive coverage configuration
- ✅ `scripts/check_coverage.py` - Python coverage validation script
- ✅ `scripts/run_coverage.sh` - Shell script for convenient coverage testing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated coverage validation

The coverage reporting system is now production-ready and will help maintain code quality as the project evolves.
