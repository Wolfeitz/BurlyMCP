"""
Burly MCP Server - Main Entry Point

This module implements the core MCP protocol handler that communicates with
AI assistants via stdin/stdout. It processes MCP requests, routes them to
appropriate tools, and returns standardized responses.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI assistants to
interact with external tools and services. This server implements the protocol
to provide secure, policy-driven access to system operations.

Key Functions:
- Parse incoming MCP JSON requests from stdin
- Route requests to appropriate tool handlers
- Implement confirmation workflow for mutating operations
- Format responses according to MCP specification
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully

Usage:
    python -m server.main

The server runs continuously, processing MCP requests until terminated.
All operations are logged for audit purposes and can optionally send
notifications via Gotify.
