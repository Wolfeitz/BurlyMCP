## Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- **Remote Code Execution**: Arbitrary code execution without authentication
- **Authentication Bypass**: Complete authentication mechanism bypass
- **Data Breach**: Access to all sensitive data without authorization
- **System Compromise**: Full system or container escape

**Examples**:

- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Access to confidential information
- **Significant DoS**: Service disruption affecting availability
- **Authentication Issues**: Partial authentication bypass

**Examples**:
- Path traversal leading to sensitive file access
- Docker socket abuse for privilege escalation
- Policy bypass allowing unauthorized tool execution

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Information Disclosure**: Limited sensitive information exposure
- **Limited DoS**: Temporary service disruption
- **Input Validation**: Injection vulnerabilities with limited impact
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default configurations

**Examples**:
- Information leakage in error messages
- Resource exhaustion causing temporary DoS
- Cross-site scripting in web interfaces

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Minor Information Disclosure**: Non-sensitive information exposure
- **Usability Issues**: Security-related usability problems
- **Documentation Issues**: Missing security documentation
- **Best Practice Violations**: Deviations from security best practices

**Examples**:
- Version information disclosure
- Insecure HTTP headers
- Missing security documentation
