- Automated security testing

## Quick Start Security Checklist

### For New Deployments

1. **Review Threat Model** - Understand the security landscape
2. **Follow Best Practices** - Implement security hardening
3. **Use Secure Configuration** - Apply configuration templates
4. **Run Security Validation** - Execute automated security checks
5. **Set Up Monitoring** - Implement security monitoring

### Security Validation

Run the automated security validation script:

```bash
# Basic validation
python scripts/security-validation.py

# Generate JSON report
python scripts/security-validation.py --report-format json --output security-report.json

# Validate specific project directory
python scripts/security-validation.py --project-root /path/to/burly-mcp
```

### Critical Security Requirements

#### ✅ Must Have (Critical)
- [ ] Container runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
- [ ] All capabilities dropped except essential ones
- [ ] Read-only root filesystem enabled
- [ ] Docker secrets used for sensitive data
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for all operations
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Security policies configured and enforced

#### ⚠️ Should Have (High Priority)
- [ ] Network isolation configured
- [ ] Resource limits enforced
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Regular vulnerability scanning enabled
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented
- [ ] Security training completed for team

#### 💡 Nice to Have (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Advanced threat detection implemented
- [ ] Security metrics and dashboards
- [ ] Automated security testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Regular penetration testing scheduled
- [ ] Security awareness program established

    end
```

### Security Layers

1. **Network Security**
   - Firewall rules and network isolation
   - TLS encryption for external communications
   - Network segmentation and access controls

2. **Container Security**
   - Non-root execution and capability dropping
   - Read-only filesystems and resource limits
   - Security profiles and runtime protection

3. **Application Security**
   - Input validation and output sanitization
   - Policy-based access control
   - Secure coding practices and code review

4. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Secret management and key rotation
   - Data classification and access controls

## Security Tools and Scripts

### Validation Scripts
- `scripts/security-validation.py` - Comprehensive security configuration validation
- `docs/security/configuration-examples.md` - Security testing scripts and examples

### Configuration Templates
- Production Docker Compose with security hardening
- Environment variable templates with security warnings
- Policy configuration examples for different environments
- Network security configuration scripts

### Monitoring Tools
- Audit log analysis scripts
- Network connection monitoring
- Security event detection and alerting
- Vulnerability scanning automation

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards Compliance
- **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security risks
- **CIS Controls** - Critical security controls implementation
- **NIST Framework** - Cybersecurity framework guidelines
- **Container Security** - Docker and Kubernetes security best practices

### Audit Requirements
- **Log Retention**: 90 days minimum for audit logs
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of permissions and policies
- **Vulnerability Management**: Monthly security scans and updates
- **Incident Documentation**: All security incidents documented and reviewed

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for intended purposes
- **Retention Limits**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to authorized personnel only
