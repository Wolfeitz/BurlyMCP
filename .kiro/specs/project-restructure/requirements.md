# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Burly MCP project currently has structural issues that prevent proper Docker builds and violate Python packaging best practices. This restructuring initiative will reorganize the codebase into a proper Python package structure, fix Docker build context issues, and establish clear module boundaries that support both development and deployment workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to follow standard Python packaging conventions, so that imports work correctly and the codebase is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Python module needs to import another project module THEN it SHALL use proper package imports (e.g., `from burly_mcp.server import main`)
2. WHEN the project is built or installed THEN all packages SHALL have proper `__init__.py` files to mark them as Python packages
3. WHEN Docker builds the container THEN it SHALL be able to access all required modules without path manipulation
4. IF a module is part of the core application THEN it SHALL be organized under a clear package hierarchy
5. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow PEP 8 naming conventions for packages and modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker builds to work reliably from the project root, so that I can deploy the application without workarounds or complex build contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker builds from the project root THEN it SHALL successfully copy all required source files
2. WHEN the Dockerfile references Python modules THEN they SHALL be available in the container without path manipulation
3. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL be able to import all required modules using standard Python import syntax
4. IF the build context is set to the project root THEN all necessary files and directories SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL not require PYTHONPATH modifications or sys.path manipulation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clear separation between application code, configuration, tests, and documentation, so that the project is easy to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL follow standard layout: `src/burly_mcp/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`
2. WHEN looking for configuration files THEN they SHALL be in `config/` directory with environment-specific variants
3. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL be in `tests/` directory with `test_*.py` naming convention
4. WHEN accessing documentation THEN it SHALL include contributor guide with code style, branching strategy, and issue conventions
5. WHEN the project is packaged THEN `.dockerignore` and build exclusions SHALL prevent unnecessary files in distributions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entry points and module interfaces to be clearly defined, so that I can understand how to run and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN there SHALL be a clear main entry point defined in setup configuration
2. WHEN importing modules THEN the public API SHALL be clearly defined through `__init__.py` files
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN module responsibilities SHALL be clearly separated
4. IF extending the application THEN the module structure SHALL support adding new components
5. WHEN packaging the application THEN entry points SHALL be properly configured in `pyproject.toml`

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the restructured project to maintain all existing security features while improving maintainability, so that security is not compromised during reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN all existing security policies SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN modules are reorganized THEN security boundaries SHALL be preserved or improved
3. WHEN Docker builds THEN the container SHALL maintain the same security posture as before
4. IF configuration files are moved THEN they SHALL retain the same access controls and validation
5. WHEN the application runs THEN all audit logging and security features SHALL work unchanged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want the project to have clear development workflows and tooling setup, so that I can contribute effectively without environment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN dependencies SHALL be explicitly defined in `pyproject.toml` with locked versions
2. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL work from the project root using pytest framework without path issues
3. WHEN using development tools THEN linting (flake8/pylint) and formatting (black) SHALL be configured to work with the new structure
4. IF making changes THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL enforce code quality standards automatically
5. WHEN building for development THEN the process SHALL be documented with step-by-step setup instructions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Docker configuration to support multi-stage builds and dynamic configuration, so that the container is optimized and adaptable to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images THEN multi-stage builds SHALL separate dependencies from runtime components
2. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN configuration SHALL be managed via environment variables without hardcoded paths
3. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL use non-root user with minimal privileges (uid 1000)
4. IF Docker socket access is needed THEN it SHALL be configurable via environment variables
5. WHEN images are built THEN they SHALL be scanned for vulnerabilities using automated tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive testing and CI/CD integration, so that code quality is maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL use pytest with pytest-cov for coverage tracking (minimum 80% coverage)
2. WHEN Docker-based functionality is tested THEN unit tests SHALL use mocking while integration tests SHALL use isolated test containers
3. WHEN code is committed THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run tests, linting, security scans, and Docker vulnerability scanning
4. IF tests involve external services THEN they SHALL use docker-compose test services or proper mocking frameworks
5. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL test both Python package installation and Docker container functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want clear packaging and distribution workflows, so that releases can be automated and versioned properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating releases THEN semantic versioning SHALL be enforced with automated version bumping for both Python package and Docker images
2. WHEN packaging for distribution THEN `pyproject.toml` SHALL define proper entry points, metadata, and console scripts
3. WHEN building Docker images THEN they SHALL be tagged with specific versions (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`) and `latest` only for stable releases
4. IF the package is distributed THEN build artifacts SHALL exclude development files via `.dockerignore` and `pyproject.toml` exclusions
5. WHEN releases are made THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically build, test, tag, and publish to Docker Hub and PyPI

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want enhanced security measures in the restructured project, so that runtime security and secrets management are properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL execute as non-root user (uid 1000) with dropped capabilities and read-only filesystem where possible
2. WHEN handling secrets THEN they SHALL use Docker secrets, environment variables, or external systems (never hardcoded)
3. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL be scanned with Trivy or similar tools and fail builds on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
4. IF sensitive configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be templated in `.env.example` with clear security warnings
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate security configurations and conduct periodic security audits of dependencies
