# Product Overview

This is a web application project with a focus on API development and security-first practices. The project emphasizes:

- **API-Centric Architecture**: Built around well-documented REST APIs with comprehensive endpoint specifications
- **Security by Design**: Automated security validation, secret detection, and vulnerability scanning
- **Development Quality**: Automated documentation sync, port management, and environment validation
- **Modern Web Stack**: Uses contemporary JavaScript/TypeScript tooling with Vite for development

## Key Principles

- All API changes must be documented with request/response schemas, authentication, and rate limiting specs
- Security validation is mandatory - no secrets in tracked files, unique port assignments, proper CORS configuration
- Development environment should be consistent and conflict-free with automated port management
- Comprehensive security scanning blocks merges until high/critical issues are resolved
