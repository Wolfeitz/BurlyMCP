# Feature-Based Spec Organization

## Task Structure Enhancement

When creating implementation plans in specs, organize tasks by features rather than sequential numbering.

### Structure Format

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Feature 1: [Feature Name]
Brief description of what this feature accomplishes.

- [ ] 1. [Task Name]
  - [ ] 1.1 [Subtask]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Subtask]
  - Requirements: [ref]

- [ ] 2. [Task Name]
  - [ ] 2.1 [Subtask]
  - Requirements: [ref]

## Feature 2: [Feature Name]
Brief description of what this feature accomplishes.

- [ ] 3. [Task Name]
  - [ ] 3.1 [Subtask]
  - Requirements: [ref]
```

### Feature Completion Workflow

1. **Complete All Tasks in Feature**: Finish all numbered tasks within a feature section
2. **Run Feature Test Analysis**: Use post-feature hook to analyze test impact
3. **Fix/Update Tests**: Address all test issues before marking feature complete
4. **Mark Feature Complete**: Only after all tasks and tests are resolved

### Benefits

- **Logical Grouping**: Related functionality stays together
- **Better Test Timing**: Test analysis happens at natural breakpoints
- **Clearer Progress**: Easy to see feature-level completion status
- **Reduced Test Churn**: Fewer test updates during development

### Implementation Guidelines

- Each feature should be cohesive and deliverable
- Features can have dependencies but should be as independent as possible
- Test analysis only happens after completing entire features
- Individual tasks within features focus on implementation, not testing
